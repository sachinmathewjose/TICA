Program to improve cognitive ability for children with autism. 
This is a software tool which doesn't require any hardware including mouse
this uses openCv to track the images and let them play games with computer to improve their cognitive ability
Here the user can use a red color marker that will act as a pointer which can be used to draw anything in the board.
The idea is to use this interaction method to play games so that the user can improve his cognitive ability. This avoids the use of any hardware like mouse
which would be difficult for a person with autism.
